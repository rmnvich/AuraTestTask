This is a fairly simple task, but the deadlines are very tight (I understand that it's intentional). 
It's not easy to extract an MVP from a somewhat chaotic requirement. Maybe it would have been better to focus only on the UI and leave the notifications for later. 
But it is what it is.

TO-DO list:
Except the technical stuff (TODOs in the code), should implement:
- Asking permissions of notification showing
- Logic of multiple boots information, not only the last one 
- Dismissing notifications and business logic of resheduling tasks because of them
- Info about special body in notification
